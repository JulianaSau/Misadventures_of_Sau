Will’s experience at the airport:

After his return from Rome, Will couldn’t find his luggage in the airport baggage area. 
He went to the lost luggage office and told the woman there that his bags hadn’t shown up on the carousel.
She smiled and told him not to worry because they were trained professionals and he was in good hands.
Then she asked Will, “Has your plane arrived yet?”
