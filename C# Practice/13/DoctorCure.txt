Funny Story About Medicine ~ The Doctor's Cure

A woman went to the doctors office, where she was seen by one of the new doctors,
but after about 4 minutes in the examination room, she burst out, screaming as she ran down the hall. 

An older doctor stopped her and asked what the problem was, and she told him her story. After listening,
he had her sat down and told her to go relax in another room. 

The older doctor marched down hallway to the back where the first doctor was and demanded, 
"What's the matter with you? Mrs. Terry is 63 years old, she has four grown children and seven grandchildren,
and you told her she was PREGNANT?" 

The new doctor continued to write on his clipboard and without looking up said, 
"Well, yes I did! But I bet her hiccups are gone now!"
